# chat_ai

I'm excited to announce the launch of my newest creation: an AI chat app crafted with Flutter and empowered by the Gemini API! ðŸ’¬âœ¨

This app allows users to engage in natural conversations with an AI chatbot, offering assistance, entertainment, and more. Whether you seek quick answers, friendly banter, or a dose of fun, this app delivers!
